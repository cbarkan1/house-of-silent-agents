# Project Overview

Welcome to the House of Silent Agents.

## Environment setup and installation

The dependencies for this project are managed using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). uv can be installed with `pipx install uv`.
Once uv is installed, run `uv sync --dev` to automatically install packages and create a virtual environment.
After that, run `uv run main.py` to run the experiment.
